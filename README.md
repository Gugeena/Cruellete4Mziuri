Cruellete is a boss rush action game set in a casino.

The game features six bosses in total. To progress, the player must defeat each boss in order.

Cruellete includes a roulette mechanic that applies a random buff to each boss throughout the fight. Each boss has a unique pool of possible buffs, changing the dynamics of the encounter. This system ensures that each playthrough's experience is unique.

After completing the game, the player receives a rank based on overall performance, ranging from C (lowest) to P (highest).

Once the main game is completed, a second game mode called THAW (short for The House Always Wins) is unlocked. It can be accessed using the now-available I/O switch on the main menu: I for THAW, O for main
THAW is a more difficult version of the main game, featuring tougher bosses and more punishing mechanics.
